# AudioClassificationProject

## Task
Investigate the techniques behind audio classification and build a neural network model that performs a supervised classification. 
For this lab we choose to go for the subdomain of audio classification of the environment sounds. Thatâ€™s why we picked the dataset UrbanSound8K. It offers sound segments sliced to at 4 seconds maximum.
Implementation was done in Python using Keras library that abstracts on top of TensorFlow. Conda virtual environment was used to run jupyter-notebook that will help to visualize each step and what was achieved.


## Dataset
Urban8k dataset contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts, each of them is less than 4 seconds long. All sounds are from an urban environment and in total there are ten classes, labeled from 0 to 9:
0. air_conditioner  
1. car_horn  
2. children_playing  
3. dog_bark  
4. drilling  
5. engine_idling
6. gun_shot
7. jackhammer
8. siren
9. street_music
